Instructions on how to upgrade java2html.

Obtain the most recent version of java2html from:
   http://www.java2html.com

Create a directory in java2html with the name java2html-x.x.x
where x.x.x is the version number of java2html.

Unzip the file into this directory.

In the new directory, remove the following (only j2h.jar is needed):
   api_examples
   docsapi
   *.bat
   *.html
   j2h

In SVN remove the old java2html directory.
